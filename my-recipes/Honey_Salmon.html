    <ol> Directions
        <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil.
             Add asparagus, cover, and steam until slightly tender, 2 to 4 minutes. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together soy sauce and honey in a small bowl until glaze is smooth. </li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source; preheat the oven broiler.
            Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and brush with olive oil. </li>
        <li>Place salmon fillet and steamed asparagus on the prepared baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Cook under the preheated broiler for 5 minutes. Drizzle 2/3 of the glaze over salmon and asparagus. 
            Continue broiling until fish flakes easily with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes. 
            Drizzle remaining glaze over salmon. </li>
    </ol>
