     <!--image-->

    <!--description-->
    <p>In the heart of Vietnamese pho lies its essence: the broth! 
        This genuine recipe involves simmering beef bones, fish sauce,
         star anise, and ginger for a minimum of 6 hours, resulting in a rich,
          fragrant broth that, while not swift to make, certainly delights the palate.
           This flavorful broth is poured over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef,
            then adorned with fresh garnishes.
